Airport Challenge
=================

For this challenge, I am creating a set of classes and modules to simulate air traffic control at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.

This challenge is incomplete. I intend on working on this during the week after speaking with coaches, fellow cohorts and my mentor.

Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```

I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller

I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy

As an air traffic controller
To ensure safety

As an air traffic controller

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
